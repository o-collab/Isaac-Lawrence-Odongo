        <h3> Prolific Short Storyst, Teacher and Novice Web developer </h3>
        <p class="purple-color"> 6 years of writing poems, short stories and one feature length story. 1 year in teaching the English language and less than a month learning web development. </p>
        <p> I have fully grasped whatever it takes to write a soul stirring story. With the mastery of writing, editing and proof reading stages, I only need more paper to keep writing. I have mastered CSS and HTML and have received the Fundamental Concepts Certificate from Programming Hero. At your service </p>
        <p> I haven't yet published but out the over 5000 entries for the 2018 Writivism Short story prize, my short story <em> Suicidal Flames </em> was among the 94 nominated. I am thrashing the Programming Hero courses. </p>
